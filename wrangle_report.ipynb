    "I began by manually downloading `'twitter-archive-enhanced.csv'` from Udacity's given URL.\n",
    "Then, I created the module `gather.py` ***(detailed docstrings within the module)***, \n",
    "which consists of the functions I needed in order to gather the required data. \n",
    "The first method - `gather.download_file_from_url` was used to download and save\n",
    "the `image_predictions.tsv` file programmatically. Then, I went on to create the functions necessary for\n",
    "getting WeRateDogs' retweet and favorites counts:\n",
    "1. `gather.get_auth`, which returns an auth object required for getting tweet's data from the tweeter API.\n",
    "2. `gather.dump_tweets_data`, which dumps json-formatted counts data into `tweets_data.json`.\n",
    "\n",
    "*SIDENOTE: It was crucial to take account of the API's rate limit, \n",
    "otherwise a lot of valid data would be ignored by the function.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, I loaded the collected data into three DataFrames:\n",
    "1. `archive_original` for `'twitter-archive-enhanced.csv'`.\n",
    "2. `tweet_cnts` for `tweets_data.json`.\n",
    "3. `img_preds` for `image_predictions.tsv`.\n",
    "\n",
    "At a quick glance, I noticed that in all of the above frames the id column is cast by default as int, So as a quick quality fix\n",
    "I've cast them to `str`, as the latter would be the appropriate data type for id.\n",
